        <p><h1>Hi, I'm Andri</h1></p>
        <p>
             I'm a .Net Developer based in  Jakarta, Indonesia. Currently, I'm work for one of Bank in Indonesia.
             I have passionate and get most  enjoyment  as a .Net Developer when  writing code readable, 
             clean code and give problem solving to my client or users. 
             <br><br>
             My coding journey started unexpectedly in my first year of vocational school in 2011.
             Because of that I'm try to explored by myself and Iâ€™m going to continue studying for Associate of Computer Science.
